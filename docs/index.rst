Overview
========

Combine is an application to facilitate the harvesting, transformation, analysis, and publishing of metadata records by Service Hubs for inclusion in the `Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) <https://dp.la/>`_.

The name "Combine", pronounced ``/kÃ¤mËŒbÄ«n/`` with a long ``i``, is a nod to the `combine harvester used in farming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_harvester>`_ used for, "combining three separate harvesting operations - reaping, threshing, and winnowing - into a single process"  Instead of grains, we have metadata records!  These metadata records may come in a variety of metadata formats, various states of transformation, and may or may not be valid in the context of a particular data model.  Like the combine equipment used for farming, this application is designed to provide a single point of interaction for multiple steps along the way of harvesting, transforming, and analyzing metadata in preperation for inclusion in DPLA.


Installation
============

Combine has a fair amount of server components, dependencies, and configurations that must be in place to work, as it leverages `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_, among other applications, for processing on the backend.

The current version of Combine uses Docker as the only means of deploying a server (starting with version v0.11). This **combine-docker** version can be found on the `MI-DPLA/combine-docker <https://github.com/MI-DPLA/combine-docker`_ github. Earlier versions of Combine used a separate GitHub repository, Combine-playbook to assist with provisioning a Combine server using Vagrant and/or Ansible.
