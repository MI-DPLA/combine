			<p>In Combine, Records undergo a processing of <span class="font-weight-bold">mapping</span> to extract discrete metadata fields from their original XML record for analysis and comparison across Records.  Mapping is performed by flattening the Record's XML document into field names that still retain semantic hints as to what XML fields they pertain too.  This mapping can be configured (and configurations saved) for each Job, <a href="https://combine.readthedocs.io/en/master/analysis.html#analyzing-indexed-fields">read more about that here</a>.</p> 

			<p>The following describes the columns in the larger table below, which is populated by Records as mapped to fields and stored in ElasticSearch.  They can provide insights into outlier Records that may not have a particular field, or provide a method to view all values of a particular mapped field.</p>

				<tr>
					<th>Column</th>

				<tr>
					<td><strong>Field Name</strong></td>
					<td>Depending on what metadata mapper was used, the field name is a rough approximation of the XML field from the original metadata record.<br><br><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:</span> If field name column is <span style="background-color:yellow;">yellow</span>, that means every Record in the Job <span class="font-italic">very likely</span> has <span class="font-weight-bold">one</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">unique</span> value for this field for all documents (this would be important for things like identifiers or access URLs).</td>

				<tr>
					<td><strong>Documents with Field</strong></td>
					<td>Count of documents with instance of this field.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Count of Total Values for Field</strong></td>
					<td>Count of total values for this field, across all documents.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Count of Distinct Values for Field</strong></td>
					<td>How many unique values are present for a given field.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Though quite accurate, this count is not gauranteed to be 100% accurate, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_approximate_aggregations.html">ES documentation</a>.  However, this should not dramatically effect analysis.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Percentage of Field Values that are Unique</strong></td>
					<td>Percentage of values for this field that are unique.  1.0 (dark green) would be entirely unique, 0.10 (lighter green) would be 10% unique.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Percentage of Documents with Field</strong></td>
					<td>Ratio of documents with an instance of this field against total number of documents.  1.0 (dark green) would mean all documents have this field, 0.10 (lighter green) would mean 10% of documents have this field.This can be useful for QA-ing mandatory fields like titles or identifiers, where 1.0 would be required.</td>
